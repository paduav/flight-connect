            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    FlightConnect is a web-based application designed to assist airline operations and customer service teams in managing flight schedules and passenger information efficiently. The platform provides a centralized view of flight status passengers, and real-time aircraft tracking.
                </strong>
            </p>

            <h2>The Information Problem</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Airline staff often rely on multiple systems and manual checks to determine whether passengers will be able to make their flights. This can slow decision-making, increase operational delays, and negatively impact the experience of other passengers.
                </strong>
            </p>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    FlightConnect addresses this challenge by consolidating flight data and passenger information into a single, easy to read interface. By providing real-time visibility into delays, check-in status, and ticket eligibility, staff can take faster and more informed action.
                </strong>
            </p>

            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Live Flight Tracking:</strong> Displays real-time aircraft position data when available.</li>
                <li><strong>Passenger Management:</strong> View passenger lists for each flight, including check-in, ticket status.</li>
                <li><strong>Ticket Reissue:</strong> Quickly reissue tickets for eligible passengers who have not checked in.</li>
                <li><strong>Delay Visualization:</strong> Highlights and sorts flights by delay severity for better prioritization.</li>
                <li><strong>Interactive Map:</strong> Shows active flights on a global map.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    FlightConnect retrieves live flight data from an external aviation API and caches the data into a database using a custom backend endpoint to ensure fast, reliable access. The frontend fetches this cached data to present consistent and up-to-date information to staff.
                </strong>
            </p>

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    By reducing reliance on manual checks and multiple systems, FlightConnect enables airline staff to respond more quickly to disruptions, minimize delays, and improve the overall travel experience.
                </strong>
